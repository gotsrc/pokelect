                <hr />
				<p>
					<strong>Pok&eacute;lect</strong> is an online trading card management database where you, the collector can see exactly what cards you have just by looking at an overview once you have marked them off. It is a unique and new way for you to manage your card collection also in the future be able to sell or put them up for trade.

                    At the moment, <strong>Pok&eacute;lect</strong> is currently undergoing heavy maintenance howevver you can still register your interest in the website and we will keep you up to date with what is happening with the application. In the future, we will need help providing scans of cards from every set so for now the lists are mainly text based however, still accessible and some stock photo's from the sets to represent them.
				</p>
            
                <p>Please bear with us and we hope to get this developed as soon as possible.</p>
